# Day-4 Summary:

Drive gets you where motivation can never get you. Watch this great video [on the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kICh_d6tHQk&ab_channel=JamesScholz).
He shares some great books that I might also read in the future : [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) and [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/).

### Things Done Today:

Completed Arrays & ArrayList in Java from [here](https://youtu.be/n60Dn0UsbEk).
Will solve these [question set](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java/blob/main/assignments/05-arrays.md) on the same tomorrow.




### Extra's:

Breaks are important and talking about [mental health](https://youtu.be/vD0w_gOEbUI) is also. Will remember that mental health is also a big part in habit building and study!
