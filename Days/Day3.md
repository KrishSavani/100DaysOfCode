# Day-3 Summary:

The more time I give to this I am feeling more confident in me. Also 
finding out that I don't need motivation from anywhere else. Loving this feeling. <3

### Things Done Today:

Completed and revised switch & functions/methods topics in Java from [Switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA23x39DjbI&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=6&ab_channel=KunalKushwaha) and [Functions](https://youtu.be/vvanI8NRlSI) videos.
