# Day-5 to 8 Summary:
Went to Vadodara to figure out a pg there. Didn't get any time for coding and didn't have access to my desktop anyways. Came back to Surat today itself.
Finalized a pg there near college after seeing bunch of flats and places. Planning on shifting near the end of November.

Since Covid hit had a sudden interaction with so many people and made new friends. Visitng college was overwhelming and attended NUVDEEP 3.0 event had a lil too much fun there.
PS. Body still aches due to the dance.

### Things Done:
Nothing.



### Extra's:
Honesty is better than you boasting about and fooling yourself.
